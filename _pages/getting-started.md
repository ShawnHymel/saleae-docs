## Introduction

The Saleae Logic Analyzer is a powerful tool capable of capturing multiple signals from a digital circuit and displaying that information in the form of timing diagrams. Saleae's *Logic* software can help you decode a variety of digital protocols, including UART, SPI, I<sup>2</sup>C, 1-Wire, I<sup>2</sup>S, CAN, USB, and many more. These features can make debugging your embedded designs much simpler.
